# Private Events

This project was completed as part of The Odin Project's Cirriculum. 

The project description can be seen [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/associations).

This small web app allows users to sign up, create events and attend events.

The purpose of this project is to get comfortable with many-to-many relationships and foreign keys and class names without relying on the Rails' defaults.
